Rust Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Rust Project Repository!

This repo is dedicated to my Rust learning journey.
I will be starting from the very basics of Rust and gradually moving towards intermediate-level concepts.

ðŸ“Œ What to Expect

Beginner-friendly code examples.

Mini projects after learning each new concept.

Weekly practice projects to apply what Iâ€™ve learned.

Clean, well-documented code for future reference.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To build a strong foundation in Rust by consistently practicing and sharing projects here.

ðŸ“… Progress Plan

Step 1 â†’ Learn core Rust syntax and concepts.

Step 2 â†’ Build small coding exercises.

Step 3 â†’ Create weekly mini-projects.

Step 4 â†’ Move towards intermediate Rust projects.

ðŸ”— Stay Tuned

Iâ€™ll be updating this repository regularly as I continue my Rust journey.
