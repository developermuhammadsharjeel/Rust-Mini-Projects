# ðŸ¦€ Rust Projects Repository  

Welcome to my **Rust Projects** repository! ðŸš€  
This repo is dedicated to my Rust learning journey where Iâ€™ll be building projects from **very small beginner-level** programs to **intermediate-level** applications.  

Whenever I learn a new concept, Iâ€™ll implement it in the form of a **mini-project** or **weekly project** and upload it here.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals of This Repository  
- Learn Rust step by step (basics â†’ advanced concepts).  
- Practice coding by making practical projects.  
- Share progress weekly by uploading projects.  
- Build a solid foundation in **systems programming** and **performance-focused development**.
